## Model-based Reinforcement Learning Experiments
This repo contains three different experiments into how to learn models (state/action transition functions) for reinforcement learning.

### MuJoCo with partial observability
Is it still possible to learn a model of the motion physics, when the observations are partially corrupted?

### Atari filter response prediction
Can an agent learn to predict it's own filter responses to frames of a video game?

### Multi-agent position inference
Can an agent learn to infere the relative position of other agents?

## Getting started
Have a look at "MDP_learning.ipynb"
